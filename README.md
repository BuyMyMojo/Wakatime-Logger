# Wakatime logger

:sunglasses: :sunglasses: :sunglasses:

## TL;DR

"Extend" the *Wakatime Free Plan* so you won't loose your logged data!

## Info

This is a Python 3.5 script which you can use to log you times from *Wakatime*.

*Wakatime* offers that with a `Free Plan` you can access your logged times for `1 week`.
Unfortunately this means that your times will be lost after a week.
So this is why I made this scrip. If you run it at least `once a week` you will have **ALL** your logged times.
Of course, you can set up to run the script automatically when your computer starts, etc... (Use your imagination) :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.

## Usuage

Just update the `config.ini` file with your `Api Key` and the `start date` for the time logger.

The start date is used for the first run.
Don't worry if you don't remember the first date for the logging,
it will recognize if a date is "valid", so it has time information stored.

Than just run it: `python wakatime_logger.py`

## TODO

- saved data visualization

## Disclaimer

I do not encourage anybody to use this scrip instead of a purchase for a Wakatime plan.
Your can upgrade the plan [here](https://wakatime.com/).
This is only an awesome project
for the usage of the Wakatime API. :v:
