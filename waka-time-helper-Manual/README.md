# Wakatime logger manual

## Setup

Just update the `config.ini` file with your `Api Key` and the `start date` for the time logger.

The start date is used for the first run.
Don't worry if you don't remember the first date for the logging,
it will recognize if a date is "valid", so it has time information stored.

## Usage

Than just run it: `python wakatime_logger.py`
